I've had the experience to work both with VM-based deployments and containerized ones. I work regularly on Docker based orchestrations, sometimes sole containers but mostly on Docker Compose. Mainly, an avid user of K8 (Kubernetes) and have managed clusters on GCP, AWS and bare metal servers. I've worked on various projects like Cloud Infra and Application Management, Cloud Migration, CI/CD on Cloud and Disaster Recovery implementations.</p>

<p class="mt-4 text-xl">✔️ A little on research, I've had the chance to work on a project that'd predict crashes on any SDN (Software Defined Network) using Information Theory, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. Also, researched about AI bots and their integration with different platforms like Facebook, Whatsapp and Skype using AIML. Further in individual research areas, I have been working in the field of audio/video encoding and its automation for different containers like Matroska.</p>
